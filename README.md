# Fraud detection
Anomaly detection in credit cards transactions (frauds) using unsupervised deep learning model - Autoencoder.

The aim of this project is predict whether a given transaction was a fraud or not. In this case we will apply anomaly detection with Autoencoder - unsupervised deep learning model. For our analysis we will use the Python, mostly Tensorflow Keras library to illustrate the process of identifying outliers using an autoencoder.

Dataset:

The dataset used for credit cards fraud detection is derived from Kaggle.

It contains transactions made by credit cards in two days in 2013 by European cardholders. There are 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
